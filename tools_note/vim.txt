vim
1. delete lines contain special characters:

    :g/hello/d

2. delete other lines that don't contain special characters(keep special symbol lines):

    :v/hello/d

3. keep the group content by '/(/)' and '\1\2', such as only keep "Aaosphaeria arxii CBS 175.79" from "--a-- 1273 1689 Aaosphaeria arxii CBS 175.79":

    :%s/.*\d\s\(\w.*\)/\1/g
