GFF3 to RefFlat for non UCSC genomes
1. download your GFF3 file from ftp://ftp.ensemblgenomes.org/pub/ (I found also TAIR10 files here)
2. download gff3ToGenePred from UCSC web site
3. run gff3ToGenePred to convert your file to GenePred file format (= refFlat)
4. run Picard CollectRnaSeqMetrics with this reference refFlat file.
